# Using-UNet-Denoising-Pictures-with-Sparse-Noise
Using U-Net for Denoising Pictures with Sparse Noise: A Deep Learning Approach for Image Denoising by Training on Clean and Noisy Image Datasets.
When viewing MRI or CT-scan images, it is common to encounter salty or other types of noise that degrade the image quality. These noises can originate from various sources, such as the scanned object or improper system calibration. In this study, we aimed to improve the quality of noisy images using a generative neural network called UNet. The advantage of this network is its ability to identify key features based on an ideal image and generate a high-quality output. In conclusion, it is important to note that all the noises in the images were artificially introduced.
